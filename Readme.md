# MLPClassifier Breast Cancer Notebook

This Jupyter notebook contains a machine learning model that uses the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier to predict breast cancer diagnosis based on the features provided in the dataset.

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
- sklearn: A machine learning library for Python. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
- seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- matplotlib: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have all the dependencies installed in your Python environment.
2. Open the `MLPCLassifier-Breast-Cancer.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells in the notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. It includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Output

The output of this notebook is a confusion matrix and a classification report that provides a summary of the precision, recall, F1 score for each class.
